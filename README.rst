This is Wilson's readme file, go to the original mcculw GitHub repository for a more basic level of information on the mcculw Python API. 

For using the qSweep script I wrote for the Measurement Computing USB-1608GX-2AO, go to mcculw/examples/console and download the qSweep.py file to C:\Users\spaydelab\Documents\Measurement Computing\mcculw-master\examples\console. Read the docstring on how to use it.

All the other qSweep files, with a test label or anything else, were made to test various things or fix stuff as I struggled immensely. Ignore them all unless you're really getting in the weeds; qSweep.py should be the only one needed.
